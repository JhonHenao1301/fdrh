          <strong>Introduction</strong>

      </ol>
      <p>
        The Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT (hereinafter referred
        to as "the Alliance") is committed to championing employee development
        for both professional advancement and personal growth. One of the
        mechanisms to honor this commitment is to support employees in obtaining
        higher education qualifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Alliance believes that providing employees with Education Support
        will strengthen employee engagement, performance, and retention.
        Moreover, the Alliance recognizes that a highly skilled workforce
        provides a competitive advantage that allows us to rapidly adapt to
        shifting organizational priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this document, the Alliance outlines Education Support and the
        guidelines that underline its access.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Organization and employee driven:</strong>Education Support
          decisions will be made considering the development of the employee and
          the areas of work, objectives, and strategic direction of the
          Alliance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency:</strong>Education Support decisions will be
          fully transparent to staff to the extent possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gender, diversity and inclusion:</strong>We strongly believe
          in diversity as a key element toward effectiveness, capacity building,
          intellectual strength, and significant contributions in the context of
          an international research organization. Education Support
          opportunities will be provided without regard to race, ethnicity,
          gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, religion,
          citizenship, and physical or mental disabilities.

          <strong>Definitions</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Higher education programs:</strong>Post-secondary education
        delivered by educational establishments, subject to progressive
        curriculum guidelines and that grant academic degrees or titles
        according to country regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Promissory note:</strong>A signed document based on local law
        that outlines the conditions for the Education Support reimbursement and
        the conditions under which the Education Support will be repaid by the
        employee.

          <strong>EDUCATION SUPPORT FRAMEWORK</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>6.1 Education support</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Education Support provides staff with up to 50% reimbursement of the
        cost of eligible qualifications of a maximum amount that will be decided
        yearly based on budget availability and approved requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event an employee is granted Education Support and he/she also
        receives additional financial support or allowances from the Alliance to
        cover eligible educational expenses for the same academic period, the
        combined support will not exceed 100% of eligible expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Education Support initiative will open once per year in the first
        quarter of the year. A second call may take place in Quarter 3 if budget
        is not allocated fully in the initial call.
      </p>
      <p>
        This program is contingent upon the annual allocation of funds for this
        purpose. This benefit does not constitute salary income for any legal
        purpose. Likewise, the support does not constitute an acquired right
        since it is granted on a discretionary basis and is subject to review
        and periodic adjustment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>6.2 Eligibility</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply for Education Support, employees must meet the following
        criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be full-time or part-time staff of the Alliance.</li>
        <li>Have at least one year of tenure within the Organization.</li>
        <li>
          Have received an 'effective' or “highly effective” performance rating
          in the last year.
        </li>
        <li>Not have a live disciplinary action.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>6.3 Eligible qualifications</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Eligible qualifications for Education Support are higher education
        programs offered by officially accredited academic institutions, such as
        BA and BS degrees, post-graduate diplomas, master's, and PhD.
      </p>
      <p>
        The qualifications must be related to the role, career development of
        the employee, or the areas of work, objectives, or strategy of the
        Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid doubt, professional memberships, certifications, training, and
        language training are not eligible for Education Support.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>6.4. Eligible expenses</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Staff can claim fees and tuition for eligible qualifications. Books,
        travel, living expenses, or any other type of expenses are not eligible
        under this Policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>6.5 Study leave</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Employees can apply for study leave to attend higher education
          courses. Study leave can be requested in conjunction with financial
          support or as a request pertaining to a self-funded higher education
          initiative.
        </li>
        <li>
          Study leave must be discussed in advance with the manager and included
          in the Education Support Request Form. Study leave will be considered
          in the context of organizational objectives, staff workload, and
          financial resources available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Study leave will not exceed 10 working days per year. Any additional
          leave required can be requested through other available leave of
          absence, such as vacation or unpaid leave.
        </li>
