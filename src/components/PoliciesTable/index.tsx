        The Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT (hereinafter referred
        to as "the Alliance") is committed to championing employee development
        for both professional advancement and personal growth. One of the
        mechanisms to honor this commitment is to support employees in obtaining
        higher education qualifications.
      </td>
      <td>
        The Alliance believes that providing employees with Education Support
        will strengthen employee engagement, performance, and retention.
        Moreover, the Alliance recognizes that a highly skilled workforce
        provides a competitive advantage that allows us to rapidly adapt to
        shifting organizational priorities.

        <strong>6.1 Education support</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Education Support provides staff with up to 50% reimbursement of the
        cost of eligible qualifications of a maximum amount that will be decided
        yearly based on budget availability and approved requests.
      </td>
      <td>
        In the event an employee is granted Education Support and he/she also
        receives additional financial support or allowances from the Alliance to
        cover eligible educational expenses for the same academic period, the
        combined support will not exceed 100% of eligible expenses.
      </td>
      <td>
        The Education Support initiative will open once per year in the first
        quarter of the year. A second call may take place in Quarter 3 if budget
        is not allocated fully in the initial call.
      </td>
      <td>
        This program is contingent upon the annual allocation of funds for this
        purpose. This benefit does not constitute salary income for any legal
        purpose. Likewise, the support does not constitute an acquired right
        since it is granted on a discretionary basis and is subject to review
        and periodic adjustment.
